All the parts work correctly as we checked with the sample output file.

When doing test_contact, the class name has to be SocialNetwork instead of SNAccount.
 
How use the Makefile? 

Compile everything required to run the main program, named trojan-book
```
make all 
```

For other tests, use one of the followings: 
```
make date
make contact
make person
```
